description: Iâ€™ve worked as a designer/illustrator for 5 years. I am flexible and fresh, with a keen eye for good design. My style is clean and bold, with subtle textures and strong typography. I enjoy exploring new mediums and techniques. My projects range from illustration and app development, to product photography and identity development.
